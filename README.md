# Project 2

## Task: 
Large machine learning (esp. deep learning) models can be pre-trained on a large amount of diverse data (usually, unlabelled data), and then be customized for various downstream tasks. In this project, you will use a pre-trained "large" foundation model to classify if a patient has ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) based on his clinical note. A small training set is provided for you to build a machine learning pipeline for this task. You may need to finetune the pre-trained model using the provided training set. You will need to apply your pipeline to the test set and save the results in "test_result.csv", in which each row is the prediction of the corresponding row in the test set.

## Datasets: 
(a) The training set file contains two columns. The first column is the notes, and the second column is the class label (TRUE or FALSE); (b) The test set file has only one column containing the notes. Each row in the training and test files represent a patient. Both files are .pkl files.

## Submit: 

[70 points] The prediction result file "test_result.csv". We will use the F1 score to evaluate the performance of your models. Please follow the format requirement specified above. Otherwise, points will be deducted depending on how much effort TAs need to parse your results. All submissions will be ranked into three groups (high, medium, and low) according to the test F1 scores. The high, medium, and low groups will receive 70, 65, and 60 points, respectively.

[30 points] Source codes with comments. You should add a report in PDF format explaining your approach(es). Each team needs to clearly specify the contributions of each team member. Points will be deducted if we do not understand your codes or reproduce your results.
Late submission penalty: 15 points. This is the default policy of this class.


Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious lung condition that causes low blood oxygen. In this project, you need to make a preidction about if the patient has ARDS based on their medical notes. Each patient may have multiple notes.

Let's explore how to fine-tune an LLM on a single commodity GPU with Ludwig, an open-source package that empowers you to effortlessly build and train machine learning models like LLMs, neural networks and tree based models through declarative config files.

In this notebook, we'll show an example of how to fine-tune Llama-2-7b to make prediction for the ARDS dataset.

By the end of this example, you will have gained a comprehensive understanding of the following key aspects:

### Ludwig:
An intuitive toolkit that simplifies fine-tuning for open-source Language Model Models (LLMs).

### Exploring the base model with prompts: 
Dive into the intricacies of prompts and prompt templates, unlocking new dimensions in LLM interaction.

### Fine-Tuning Large Language Models:
Navigate the world of model fine-tuning optimizations for getting the most out of a single memory-contrained GPU, including: LoRA and 4-bit quantization.

## Goal: Use LLMs For Medical-Case Prediction 🏥

In this webinar, the goal is to use an LLM for prediction. The model will take natural language as input, and should return true(ARDS patient)/false(Non-ARDS patient) as output. We're first going to iterate on a base Llama-2-7b model with prompting, and finally instruction-fine-tune the model.

As an example, if we prompt the model with this instruction:

> Instruction: Based on the provided context, return true if the pation has ARDS, otherwise return false.

## A Quick 2 Minute Introduction To Ludwig

Every Ludwig model is based on a config, which requires at least input feature and one output feature to be defined. For example,

> input_features:
> 
>  - name: instruction
>    
>    type: text
>    
>output_features:
> 
> - name: output
> - 
>    type: text

is a simple Ludwig config that tells Ludwig to use the column called instruction in our dataset as an input feature and the output column in our dataset as an output feature. This is the simplest Ludwig config we can define - it's just 6 lines and works out of the box!

To make Ludwig compatible with LLMs, Ludwig 0.8 introduced a new model_type called llm and a new keyword base_model that must be specified:

>model_type: llm
>
>base_model: meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf
>
>input_features:
>
>  - name: instruction
>    type: text
>    
> output_features:
>
> - name: output
>
> - type: text
    
    
The model_type parameter indicates is used to tell Ludwig you want to use the LLM model type (Ludwig supports LLMs, general deep neural networks and trees). The base_model parameter is the path to any HuggingFace CausalLM listed here.

For this webinar, we're going to make use of the Python LudwigModel API. This requires just one main object during initialization: a YAML config defining your training pipeline. The initialized LudwigModel object then exposes a variety of methods like preprocess(), train(), evaluate() and predict(). We will see this in practice in the next few sections.

## Basic Setup 🧰

We're going to install Ludwig, setup our HuggingFace Token and load our dataset that we will be running experiments with.

# Setup Your HuggingFace Token 🤗
We'll be exploring Llama-2 today, which a model released by Meta. However, the model is not openly-accessible and requires requesting for access (assigned to your HuggingFace READ token).

Obtain a HuggingFace API Token and request access to Llama2-7b-hf before proceeding. You may need to signup on HuggingFace if you don't aleady have an account: https://huggingface.co/join

Incase you haven't been given access to Llama-2-7b, that is alright. We can just use Llama-1 for the rest of this example: huggyllama/llama-7b.

Left lower lobe remains collapsed accompanied by small to moderate pleural effusion on that side. No pneumothorax. Heart is very large but stable post-operatively and there is no pulmonary edema. Note 5: CHEST RADIOGRAPH INDICATION: Chest tube placement. COMPARISON: ___. FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a right-sided chest tube has been placed. The tube is in correct position. The extent of right pleural effusion has slightly decreased. There is a small extrathoracic air collection at the site of tube insertion. No evidence of right-sided pneumothorax. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the left lung base, with an extensive left basal atelectasis. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. Note 6: CHEST CT ON ___ HISTORY: Pleural effusion and bacteremia. TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed without intravenous contrast agent reconstructed as contiguous 5- and 1.25-mm thick axial and 5-mm thick coronal and parasagittal images, read in conjunction with chest radiographs ___ through ___: FINDINGS: Moderate size nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion layers posteriorly. A moderate-sized pericardial effusion greatest in the region normally occupied by the left atrial appendage is separated from cardiac chambers by preserved epicardial fat. The attenuation of the pericardial and pleural effusions though below that of frank hemorrhage is above that of simple transudate, which is what one would expect following surgery where fluid has been present for several days and may have small components of blood. There is no radiographic evidence of tamponade physiology. Atelectasis is present in all of the basal segments of the left lower lobe and the posterior basal and some of the lateral basal on the right. Central bronchi are not obstructed. Right apical and anterior pneumothorax is very small. Right pleural tube running up the major fissure to the upper posterior hemithorax, is filled with material. Whether it is occluded can be judged clinically, but conceivably it is isolated from the right pleural effusion. There is no pneumonia. Sternal fragments are closely applied in the body of the sternum, more separated in the manubrium, but the postoperative appearance at all levels is unremarkable and there is no associated fluid collection. Heart is severely enlarged, particularly the atria. Mitral annulus is heavily calcified. IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are dependent, with no good evidence for loculation or acute hemorrhage. Differentiation of empyema from persistent, noninfectious, postoperative effusion is not possible radiographically, but should be feasible with image-directed thoracentesis. Pericardial effusion is moderate, with no evidence of tamponade physiology. Right pleural tube is fissural and may be isolated from the right pleural effusion and small right pneumothorax. 2. Bibasilar atelectasis attributable to the pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumonia. 3. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly predominantly atrial. MVR within heavily calcified mitral annulus. Note 7: PORTABLE CHEST, ___ COMPARISON: Radiograph of ___. FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.

Marked scoliosis of the thoracic spine is again noted. IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax on right side. Left effusion and probable atelectasis persists. Note 11: PICC LINE PLACEMENT INDICATION: IV access needed for antibiotics. The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was performed. RADIOLOGIST: Drs. ___ performed the procedure. TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right basilic vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous access are on file. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a guide wire, and a 4 ___ single lumen PICC line measuring 39 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. The position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications.

| 0 | Note 1: ADDENDUM: In the impression, it states that the free fluid within the rectovesicular space with the layering hematocrit could be a possible bowel perforation. This is incorrect. This fluid collection in the pelvis represents an intraperitoneal extension of the right retroperitoneal hematoma and is not suggestive of bowel perforation. Note 2: REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Hypoxemia. Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___. There is interval progression of left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation currently obscuring the entire left lower lobe and the hemidiaphragm. There is also progression of the right basal consolidation and new right pleural effusion demonstrated. Upper lungs are essentially unchanged. Replaced mitral valve projecting over the significantly calcified mitral annulus is redemonstrated. The right PICC line tip is at the level of low SVC. Note 3: REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Dyspnea. Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to a prior study obtained on ___. Current study demonstrates interval progression of pulmonary edema, interstitial on the top of previously described consolidations and pleural effusion. Note 4: AP CHEST 8:39 A.M. ON ___ HISTORY: An ___ man re-admitted with shortness of breath after MVR. Evaluate for effusion. IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to ___: Moderate to large right pleural effusion not changed appreciably since ___. Left lower lobe remains collapsed accompanied by small to moderate pleural effusion on that side. No pneumothorax. Heart is very large but stable post-operatively and there is no pulmonary edema. Note 5: CHEST RADIOGRAPH INDICATION: Chest tube placement. COMPARISON: ___. FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a right-sided chest tube has been placed. The tube is in correct position. The extent of right pleural effusion has slightly decreased. There is a small extrathoracic air collection at the site of tube insertion. No evidence of right-sided pneumothorax. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the left lung base, with an extensive left basal atelectasis. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. Note 6: CHEST CT ON ___ HISTORY: Pleural effusion and bacteremia. TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed without intravenous contrast agent reconstructed as contiguous 5- and 1.25-mm thick axial and 5-mm thick coronal and parasagittal images, read in conjunction with chest radiographs ___ through ___: FINDINGS: Moderate size nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion layers posteriorly. A moderate-sized pericardial effusion greatest in the region normally occupied by the left atrial appendage is separated from cardiac chambers by preserved epicardial fat. The attenuation of the pericardial and pleural effusions though below that of frank hemorrhage is above that of simple transudate, which is what one would expect following surgery where fluid has been present for several days and may have small components of blood. There is no radiographic evidence of tamponade physiology. Atelectasis is present in all of the basal segments of the left lower lobe and the posterior basal and some of the lateral basal on the right. Central bronchi are not obstructed. Right apical and anterior pneumothorax is very small. Right pleural tube running up the major fissure to the upper posterior hemithorax, is filled with material. Whether it is occluded can be judged clinically, but conceivably it is isolated from the right pleural effusion. There is no pneumonia. Sternal fragments are closely applied in the body of the sternum, more separated in the manubrium, but the postoperative appearance at all levels is unremarkable and there is no associated fluid collection. Heart is severely enlarged, particularly the atria. Mitral annulus is heavily calcified. IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are dependent, with no good evidence for loculation or acute hemorrhage. Differentiation of empyema from persistent, noninfectious, postoperative effusion is not possible radiographically, but should be feasible with image-directed thoracentesis. Pericardial effusion is moderate, with no evidence of tamponade physiology. Right pleural tube is fissural and may be isolated from the right pleural effusion and small right pneumothorax. 2. Bibasilar atelectasis attributable to the pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumonia. 3. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly predominantly atrial. MVR within heavily calcified mitral annulus. Note 7: PORTABLE CHEST, ___ COMPARISON: Radiograph of ___. FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.

Left pleural effusion is present, best seen on the lateral film. Calcification of mitral annulus is present. Left lower lobe atelectasis is probably also present. Marked scoliosis of the thoracic spine is again noted. IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax on right side. Left effusion and probable atelectasis persists. Note 11: PICC LINE PLACEMENT INDICATION: IV access needed for antibiotics. The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was performed. RADIOLOGIST: Drs. ___ performed the procedure. TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right basilic vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous access are on file. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a guide wire, and a 4 ___ single lumen PICC line measuring 39 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. The position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 4 ___ single lumen PICC line placement via the right basilic venous approach. Final internal length is 39 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use. Note 12: REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient after mitral valve repair.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: The visible osseous structures show levocurvature of the thoracic spine and sternotomy wires, which are intact, but no fractures, suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are noted. IMPRESSION: 1. Left greater than right pleural effusions, slightly decreased on the right and increased on the left, with associated compressive atelectasis and likely mild pulmonary edema. 2. 4 x 5.7 lobulated hyperdense lesion in the subcutaneous tissues of the left lower back may represent a sebaceous cyst, but other entities are not excluded and this is not fully characterized. An ultrasound may be obtained for further evaluation if clinically indicated. Note 18: INDICATION: Left effusion, status post thoracentesis. COMPARISON: Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently chest CT ___. FINDINGS: There is improved aeration of the left upper lung field.

The other aspect worth noting is the average number of characters in each of the three columns instruction, input and output in the dataset. Typically, every 3-4 characters maps to a token (the basic building blocks that language models use to understand and analyze text data), and large language models have a limit on the number of tokens they can take as input.

```
# Calculating the length of each cell in each column
df['num_characters_instruction'] = df['instruction'].apply(lambda x: len(x))
df['num_characters_notes'] = df['notes'].apply(lambda x: len(x))
df['num_characters_output'] = df['output'].apply(lambda x: len(x))

# Show Distribution
df.hist(column=['num_characters_instruction', 'num_characters_notes', 'num_characters_output'])

# Calculating the average
average_chars_instruction = df['num_characters_instruction'].median()

Average number of tokens in the instruction column: 78
Average number of tokens in the notes column: 1738
Average number of tokens in the output column: 2

The maximum context length for the base LLaMA-2 model is 4096 tokens. However, since we are using a free GPU, the GPU Memory limits the token length to around 400. We need to truncate the medical notes to avoid out-of-memory issue. A dummy method is to the get the first 400-78(instruction token)-2(output token)=320 tokens(1260 characters) in the notes and drop the rest. Later, you will need to design your own method to truncate the notes. If you get an CUDA OUT OF MEMORY error during fine-tuning, you may come back to this cell and use a more strict token limit. You can monitor the GPU RAM usage on the top right.

| 0 | Note 1: ADDENDUM: In the impression, it states that the free fluid within the rectovesicular space with the layering hematocrit could be a possible bowel perforation. This is incorrect. This fluid collection in the pelvis represents an intraperitoneal extension of the right retroperitoneal hematoma and is not suggestive of bowel perforation. Note 2: REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Hypoxemia. Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___. There is interval progression of left lower lobe retrocardiac consolidation currently obscuring the entire left lower lobe and the hemidiaphragm. There is also progression of the right basal consolidation and new right pleural effusion demonstrated. Upper lungs are essentially unchanged. Replaced mitral valve projecting over the significantly calcified mitral annulus is redemonstrated. The right PICC line tip is at the level of low SVC. Note 3: REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Dyspnea. Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to a prior study obtained on ___. Current study demonstrates interval progression of pulmonary edema, interstitial on the top of previously described consolidations and pleural effusion. Note 4: AP CHEST 8:39 A.M. ON ___ HISTORY: An ___ man re-admitted with shortness of breath after MVR. Evaluate for effusion. IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to ___: Moderate to large right pleural effusion not changed appreciably since ___. Left lower lobe remains collapsed accompanied by small to moderate pleural effusion on that side. No pneumothorax. Heart is very large but stable post-operatively and there is no pulmonary edema. Note 5: CHEST RADIOGRAPH INDICATION: Chest tube placement. COMPARISON: ___. FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a right-sided chest tube has been placed. The tube is in correct position. The extent of right pleural effusion has slightly decreased. There is a small extrathoracic air collection at the site of tube insertion. No evidence of right-sided pneumothorax. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the left lung base, with an extensive left basal atelectasis. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. Note 6: CHEST CT ON ___ HISTORY: Pleural effusion and bacteremia. TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed without intravenous contrast agent reconstructed as contiguous 5- and 1.25-mm thick axial and 5-mm thick coronal and parasagittal images, read in conjunction with chest radiographs ___ through ___: FINDINGS: Moderate size nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion layers posteriorly. A moderate-sized pericardial effusion greatest in the region normally occupied by the left atrial appendage is separated from cardiac chambers by preserved epicardial fat. The attenuation of the pericardial and pleural effusions though below that of frank hemorrhage is above that of simple transudate, which is what one would expect following surgery where fluid has been present for several days and may have small components of blood. There is no radiographic evidence of tamponade physiology. Atelectasis is present in all of the basal segments of the left lower lobe and the posterior basal and some of the lateral basal on the right. Central bronchi are not obstructed. Right apical and anterior pneumothorax is very small. Right pleural tube running up the major fissure to the upper posterior hemithorax, is filled with material. Whether it is occluded can be judged clinically, but conceivably it is isolated from the right pleural effusion. There is no pneumonia. Sternal fragments are closely applied in the body of the sternum, more separated in the manubrium, but the postoperative appearance at all levels is unremarkable and there is no associated fluid collection. Heart is severely enlarged, particularly the atria. Mitral annulus is heavily calcified. IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are dependent, with no good evidence for loculation or acute hemorrhage. Differentiation of empyema from persistent, noninfectious, postoperative effusion is not possible radiographically, but should be feasible with image-directed thoracentesis. Pericardial effusion is moderate, with no evidence of tamponade physiology. Right pleural tube is fissural and may be isolated from the right pleural effusion and small right pneumothorax. 2. Bibasilar atelectasis attributable to the pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumonia. 3. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly predominantly atrial. MVR within heavily calcified mitral annulus. Note 7: PORTABLE CHEST, ___ COMPARISON: Radiograph of ___. FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.

Note 11: PICC LINE PLACEMENT INDICATION: IV access needed for antibiotics. The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was performed. RADIOLOGIST: Drs. ___ performed the procedure. TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right basilic vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous access are on file. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a guide wire, and a 4 ___ single lumen PICC line measuring 39 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. The position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 4 ___ single lumen PICC line placement via the right basilic venous approach.
